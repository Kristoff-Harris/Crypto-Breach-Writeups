Summary of the Attack: 
- At the time of the ICO, somehow the webpage which instructed users where to send crypto to was compromised. The attack involved the original Wallet address which the 
  funds were to be sent to being replaced with the Wallet address of the attacker....
  
Likely Causes of Vulnerability: 
- It's really anyone's guess... My hunch would be...
    - Poor SSH or Admin Panel credential strength 
    - Malicious file upload which led to an attacker being able to overwrite the original page with their slightly modified one
    - Stored XSS wherein there could have been something like a comment field that a script was injected into... then the script replaced the address based 
      on where it resided in the page, or just did a brute regex to find it and replace it with a .innerHTML type of method.
