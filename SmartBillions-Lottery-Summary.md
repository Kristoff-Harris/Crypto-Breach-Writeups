SmartBillions Lottery Contract Hack
===============================================================================


What was SmartBillions Lottery?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
During a hackathon, there was a team that created a lottery style Dapp which 
allowed for a user to specify a 6 digit numeric guess which they would bet on.

Based on how many digits they got correct, that dictated how much the contract 
paid out. 

It is widely believed that this project was created to be intentionally vuln
due a core game mechanic being deeply flawed.
